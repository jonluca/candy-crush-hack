## Note

To run this program you will need access to your save game file. This is easily acquired through various methods. 

I'd recommend iFunbox if you're on Windows. Connect your iPhone to your PC and open up iFunbox. For what it’s worth, I prefer to use the application’s classic interface – it just seems more straightforward. Navigate to User Applications > Candy Crush > Documents as shown below and copy the save_##########.dat file to your computer. I suggest making a backup of this file just in case you screw things up along the way.
