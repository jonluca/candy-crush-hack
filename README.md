## Note

To run this program you will need access to your save game file. This is easily acquired through various methods. 

I'd recommend [iFunbox](i-funbox.com/) if you're on Windows. Connect your iPhone to your PC and open up iFunbox. For what it’s worth, I prefer to use the application’s classic interface – it just seems more straightforward. Navigate to User Applications > Candy Crush > Documents as shown below and copy the save_##########.dat file to your computer. This program automatically creates a back up at in the same directory as your save game file (just with .bak appended).

If you're on a Mac, I'd recommend [iExplorer](https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/). Follow the procedure above.

I leave it as an exercise to the user to go more in depth than this - if you really need more help, google around for a few guides or check out [/r/jailbreak on reddit](http://reddit.com/r/jailbreak) and ask for help there. Should be fairly trivial to get the save games off/back on your device, though.

This is confirmed to work through iOS 10.2 on December 21st, 2016.
